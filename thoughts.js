// ************ THOUGHTS ************ //
// 1. Make 'Click for description 'button as 'See More Posts' button
        // on click populates all the posts, including any created posts

// 2. Make 'Share your experience' button still pop up a modal, but created post will just save to database
        // all posts will populate when you click 'See More Posts'

// 3. However, how will this affect Update and Delete?

// 4. Possible to 'click' on post within drop down box?

// 5. Must just be better to have regular 'link' for 'See More Posts' that just pushes post object onto page
        // Can then add update/delete buttons to each div that populates
        // unique event listener for each update/delete button


// ************ TODOS ************ //
// 1. Submit button also closes and hitting return will submit
// 2. FIGURE OUT HOW TO: get postId and trailId in url --> open to form.html
